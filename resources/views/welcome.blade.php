{{--                    Today, just as in An Enemy of the People, some leaders claim that the Corona Virus pandemic is overblown especially if the required restrictions affect their popularity and some people decry such restrictions on their âfreedomâ. But not telling people the truth about a bad situation the may face is simple, while telling people things they would not want to hear is difficult, and, as a result, a test of risk leadership. Indeed, Risk Leadership is not about taking actions that are popular in uncertain times, but as I have defined it, it is the ability of a leader to take risks or to deal with uncertainty in a manner that is good for everyone involved in and affected by the leaderâs actions. We can better understand the essence of risk leadership if we situate, for instance, the uncertainty that the coronavirus poses within the Tame-Wicked-Critical problems framework.--}}

{{--                    Tame problems are complicated, known (likely to have occurred before) problems with known solutions that are within the purview of experts. They are to a large extent characterise by certainty and thus are associated with Management. To solve the problem, the managementâs role, therefore, is to provide the appropriate processes â or standard operating procedure (SOP). Covid-19 testing can be put in this categoryâwe know how to do it, provided the means and knowhow are available.--}}

{{--                    <br>--}}
{{--                    Wicked Problems are complex beyond being complicated. They do not have right or wrong solutions, but good or bad developments and, therefore, have no definition of success. Put differently, there is a great degree of uncertainty in Wicked Problems, both in terms of their causes and effects besides, as I have just said, in terms of the solutions they required. If we knew what their exact causes and effects were and how to fix them, they would be Tame Problems, not Wicked Problems. Leadership is often mistakenly associated with the exact opposite - the ability to solve problems, to act decisively, and to know what to do. This, actually, is what management is about. Managers deal with certainty. They embrace the process, seek stability and control, and instinctively try to solve problems quickly, sometimes before they fully understand the importance of a problem. Leaders, on the other hand, deal with uncertainty. They embrace chaos and lack of structure and are willing to delay closure in order to better understand the issues. In this way, true leaders have much more in common with artists and other creative thinkers. Taking one''s good management skills for leadership creates pressure to act decisively and therefore often leads to trying (and failing) to solve Wicked Problems as if they were Tame Problems. For Instance, when Global Warming first emerged as a problem, some of the responses focused on solving the problem through science (a Tame response), manifested in the development of biofuels; but we now know that biofuels seem to rob the world of important food resources, so what looked like a solution has become another problem. Again, this is typical of what happens when we try to solve Wicked Problems; other problems arise to make the original problem worse.--}}

{{--                    <br>--}}
{{--                    Additionally, Wicked Problems are usually intractable so that we must learn to endure them, often in a divided fashion on the basis of conflicting convictions. What I am suggesting is that, since Wicked Problems are partly characterised by the absence of a solution, the leaderâs responsibility is therefore to ask the right questions rather than to provide the right answers because the answers may not be compelling and will require a collaborative process to mitigate the impact of the problem. The leader then must engage the collective in solving the problem and to rally the community to help itself whenever possible and to cope with the new reality. This is, today, similar to the call for social distancing, quarantine and mutual assistance.--}}

{{--                    Critical problems are crises, that is, risks that have materialised. They require urgent action. The individual having authority acts as the Commander and dictates the response to the situation. Here, there is no uncertainty as to what needs to be done although there may be some uncertainty (which does not immediately matter) as to the cause of the problem. There is no need nor time to initiate processes (Management) or ask questions (Leadership). The success of a commanderâs action depends solely on his leadership skills and qualities. But, all kinds of problems arise when the Commander sees himself as a god who thinks they can do as they wish with people. Evidently, the Commander may in private remain uncertain as to whether their action is appropriate or whether the reframing of the problem as a crisis is convincing, but this uncertainty is unlikely to be evident to people. Ordering the closure of schools, businesses, restaurants and places of worship for the foreseeable future would be an example of tackling a critical problem.--}}

{{--                    <br>--}}
{{--                    <br>--}}
{{--                    It often happens that the same person in position of authority switches between management, leadership and command approaches according to how they perceive or establish the problem as Tame, Wicked or Critical, or as a problem moves across these confines. The perception or establishment of a problem may lead to a dangerous mismatch between the approach and the problem. Indeed, if we approach the problem from the wrong angle, then we risk making it worse. Therefore, indecision on what to do and the search for collective ideas when uncertainty has materialised such as the pandemic we are going through right now, is exercising Leadership when command is required. Equally, requiring for example businesses to shut down without considering or caring about the wider impact on the community as people are losing their income, is to confuse the importance of leadership with suitability of command. But unless one takes expert advice on what to do, one can be decisively wrong, and ignoring experts in order to promote self-interest or the interest of a minority group, is just as likely to lead to chaos.--}}

{{--                    That Risk Leadership is similar to any other form of leadership but just applied to the risk or uncertainty explains both its importance and paradox. It is the most vital approach vital in today''s world which made of complex and interconnected uncertainties, yet, it remains one of the three approaches which most individual in position of authority will try to stay away from because it entails that: (1) they do not have the answer to the problem, (2) their mission is to have people assume their responsibilities and adapt to the reality of the problem, ( 3) that it will require a long time to build the âanswerâ to the problem and that this answer will only lessen the effects of the problem, not solve it, and (4) that it will require constant efforts to maintain the answer, although its greatest advantage is that it will allow people to collectively adapt to the problem or to live with it. It requires the risk leader to have the ability to inspire people to give up some their privileges and to be compassionate with one another. Obviously, it is much easier to opt for either a management approach - engaging a proven and reliable process - or a command approach - imposing the response on people. This and because of the realities of the world we live in today explains the need to equip the leaders in our organisations and institutions with Risk Leadership capabilities.--}}
